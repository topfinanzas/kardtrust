# AdZep Integration Guide

## Overview

The AdZep tag has been successfully integrated into this Next.js project with a comprehensive implementation that handles both script loading and function invocation requirements.

## Components

### 1. Main AdZep Component (`/components/analytics/adzep.tsx`)

The core AdZep implementation includes:

- **AdZep**: Main component that loads the AdZep script
- **useAdZep**: Hook for manual AdZep activation
- **AdZepCentralizedHandler**: Single centralized handler for ad activation (integrated in Header) - **ONLY ACTIVATION POINT**
- **AdZepLinkHandler**: Simplified link tracking (no ad activation)
- **AdZepNavigationHandler**: Simplified navigation tracking (no ad activation)

### 2. Enhanced Trackers (`/components/analytics/adzep-trackers.tsx`)

Additional tracking components for specific use cases:

- **AdZepLinkTracker**: Enhanced link interaction tracking (NO ACTIVATION - tracking only)
- **AdZepFormTracker**: Form submission and interaction tracking (NO ACTIVATION - tracking only)
- **AdZepPageTracker**: Page visibility change tracking (NO ACTIVATION - tracking only)

### 3. Manual Triggers (`/components/analytics/adzep-trigger.tsx`)

Components for manual AdZep activation:

- **AdZepTrigger**: Wrapper component for custom trigger events
- **AdZepButton**: Pre-configured button with AdZep activation
- **AdZepLink**: Pre-configured link with AdZep activation

## Implementation Details

### Global Setup

The AdZep script is loaded globally in `app/layout.tsx`:

```tsx
import AdZep, { AdZepNavigationHandler } from "@/components/analytics/adzep";

// In the head section:
<ClientOnly>
  {/* GTM snippet is hardcoded natively in <head> & <body> */}
  <AdZep />
</ClientOnly>

// In the body section:
<NavigationProvider>
  <Suspense fallback={null}>
    <UtmPersister />
    <AdZepNavigationHandler />
    {process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" && <UtmMonitor />}
  </Suspense>
  {children}
</NavigationProvider>
```

### Script Loading

The AdZep script is loaded with Next.js optimization:

- Uses `strategy="afterInteractive"` for optimal performance
- Preserves the original `data-cfasync="false"` attribute
- Includes error handling and performance monitoring
- Integrates with the existing analytics infrastructure

### Function Invocation

The `window.AdZepActivateAds()` function is called automatically:

1. **On page load**: When the page initially loads
2. **On navigation**: When users navigate between pages
3. **On link clicks**: When any link is clicked
4. **On custom events**: When manually triggered

## Centralized Activation Strategy

### Single Point of Activation

The AdZep implementation uses a **centralized activation strategy** to prevent redundant calls:

- **Only `AdZepCentralizedHandler`** calls `window.AdZepActivateAds()`
- **All other components** are for tracking/logging purposes only
- **Debouncing mechanism** prevents rapid successive calls within 500ms
- **Comprehensive coverage** handles all navigation types (initial load, routing, browser navigation)

### Why This Approach?

1. **Prevents Google Ad Loading Issues**: Multiple calls to `window.AdZepActivateAds()` cause Google to attempt loading multiple ads into the same `div` element, which is unsupported and can prevent ad display entirely.

2. **Eliminates Redundancy**: No duplicate calls or fallback mechanisms that could interfere with proper ad loading.

3. **Maintains Performance**: Single, efficient activation point with proper timing and error handling.

4. **Ensures Reliability**: Consistent activation across all navigation scenarios without conflicts.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Automatic)

The AdZep system works automatically once integrated into the layout. No additional setup is required for basic functionality.

### Enhanced Page Tracking

For pages that need enhanced tracking, add the tracker components:

```tsx
import AdZepLinkTracker, {
  AdZepFormTracker,
} from "@/components/analytics/adzep-trackers";

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <AdZepLinkTracker />
      <AdZepFormTracker />
      {/* Your page content */}
    </main>
  );
}
```

### Manual Activation

For programmatic control:

```tsx
import { useAdZep } from "@/components/analytics/adzep";

function MyComponent() {
  const { activateAds } = useAdZep();

  const handleSpecialEvent = () => {
    // Your custom logic
    activateAds(); // Manually trigger AdZep
  };

  return <button onClick={handleSpecialEvent}>Special Action</button>;
}
```

### Custom Trigger Components

For specific elements that need AdZep activation:

```tsx
import AdZepTrigger, { AdZepButton, AdZepLink } from "@/components/analytics/adzep-trigger";

// Wrapper approach
<AdZepTrigger trigger="hover">
  <div>Hover to activate ads</div>
</AdZepTrigger>

// Pre-configured components
<AdZepButton onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</AdZepButton>
<AdZepLink href="/some-page">Navigate and Activate</AdZepLink>
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### UTM Tracking

AdZep works seamlessly with the existing UTM tracking system:

- UTM parameters are preserved during navigation
- AdZep activation doesn't interfere with UTM parameter persistence
- Both systems can track user interactions independently

### Google Tag Manager

AdZep is loaded alongside GTM:

- Both scripts use appropriate loading strategies
- Performance monitoring tracks both systems
- Error handling is independent for each system

### Navigation System

AdZep integrates with the Next.js navigation system properly:

- Router changes trigger AdZep activation using `usePathname()` hook
- Back/forward navigation is handled via `popstate` events
- Client-side navigation is properly tracked on every route change
- Initial page load activation is handled separately
- All navigation types (internal links, browser navigation, direct URL access) trigger ads

## Performance Considerations

### Script Loading Strategy

- Uses Next.js `Script` component with `afterInteractive` strategy
- Script is loaded after the page becomes interactive
- Includes performance monitoring and error handling

### Event Handling

- Passive event listeners where appropriate
- Efficient event delegation for link tracking
- Minimal performance impact on page interactions

### Memory Management

- Proper cleanup of event listeners
- Component unmounting is handled correctly
- No memory leaks in the tracking system

## Development and Debugging

### Development Mode

In development mode, the system provides detailed logging:

```javascript
// Console output examples:
"AdZep: Link interaction detected" { type: "A", href: "/some-page", text: "Link text" }
"AdZep: Form submission detected"
"AdZep: Page became visible"
"AdZep: Manual trigger activated (click)"
```

### Error Handling

All AdZep operations include try-catch blocks:

- Script loading errors are logged
- Function call errors are handled gracefully
- System continues to work even if AdZep fails

### Performance Monitoring

Performance marks are created for monitoring:

- `adzep-start`: When component mounts
- `adzep-loaded`: When script finishes loading
- `adzep-execution`: Measure from start to loaded

## Best Practices

### When to Use Enhanced Tracking

Use enhanced tracking components on:

- High-interaction pages (forms, quizzes, recommenders)
- Important conversion pages
- Pages with complex user flows

### When to Use Manual Triggers

Use manual triggers for:

- Custom events not covered by automatic tracking
- Specific business logic requirements
- A/B testing scenarios

### Performance Optimization

- Only load enhanced trackers on pages that need them
- Use manual triggers sparingly
- Monitor performance impact in production

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Script not loading**: Check network connectivity and script URL
2. **Function not available**: Ensure script has loaded before calling
3. **Multiple activations**: This is expected and handled gracefully

### Debugging Steps

1. Check browser console for AdZep-related logs
2. Verify script is loaded in Network tab
3. Test `window.AdZepActivateAds()` manually in console
4. Check performance marks for timing issues

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

- A/B testing integration
- Advanced event filtering
- Custom event tracking
- Analytics dashboard integration

### Configuration Options

Consider adding configuration for:

- Activation frequency limits
- Event type filtering
- Environment-specific behavior
- Custom activation triggers

This implementation provides a robust, Next.js-optimized solution for AdZep integration that maintains performance while ensuring reliable ad activation across your site.

**Most importantly, the functionality and performance of the AdZep implementation remain unmodified and continue to work optimally**, with the key improvement being the elimination of redundant activation calls that could interfere with proper ad display. The centralized approach ensures sustained functionality and peak performance across all navigation scenarios.
