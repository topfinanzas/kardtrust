                  The Robinhood Gold Card represents a fundamental shift in how
                  credit cards reward consumers. By offering a flat 3% cash back
                  rate on all purchases, Robinhood eliminates the complexity and
                  mental overhead of traditional rewards programs. You don't
                  need to track rotating categories, activate quarterly bonuses,
                  or remember which card to use where. Every purchase earns the
                  same generous 3% back automatically, with cash deposited
                  directly into your Robinhood brokerage account where it can be
                  invested for potential long-term growth.

                  The Power of Unlimited 3% Cash Back
                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  Most credit cards claiming "unlimited rewards" offer only 1.5%
                  or 2% cash back on everything. Cards with higher rates
                  typically impose category restrictions, spending caps, or
                  complex tier systems. The Robinhood Gold Card's flat 3% rate
                  on all purchases—with no annual spending limit—means you earn
                  more on every dollar you spend. For someone spending $30,000
                  annually on their credit card, that's $900 in cash back
                  compared to just $450 with a typical 1.5% card or $600 with a
                  2% card. The extra $300-$450 annually adds up significantly
                  over time, especially when invested in your Robinhood
                  portfolio.

                  The 5% cash back on travel bookings through the Robinhood
                  Travel Portal rivals cards with $450+ annual fees. Whether
                  you're booking a business trip or family vacation, that extra
                  2% back (compared to the standard 3%) can quickly offset the
                  cost of your Robinhood Gold membership. A $3,000 family
                  vacation booked through the portal earns $150 back instead of
                  $90—a $60 difference that covers your entire year of Gold
                  membership ($60). The travel portal offers competitive rates
                  on flights, hotels, and rental cars from major providers,
                  making it easy to maximize your rewards without sacrificing
                  choice or convenience.

                  Revolutionary Virtual Card Technology
                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  Virtual cards are one of the Gold Card's most innovative
                  features, offering enhanced security and control over your
                  online spending. Generate unique, disposable card numbers for
                  each merchant or subscription service. If a virtual card
                  number is compromised in a data breach, only that number is
                  affected— your physical card and other virtual numbers remain
                  secure. You can also set spending limits or lock individual
                  virtual cards without affecting your other payment methods.
                  This makes managing subscriptions effortless: assign each
                  service its own virtual card, and simply delete the virtual
                  card when you want to cancel without worrying about lingering
                  charges.

                  calculated in points (1 point = $0.01) and can be redeemed

                  for you through investments. Redeem points for stocks, ETFs,
                  options, or crypto, or keep them as cash earning 3% APY.
                  Unlike traditional cash back cards where rewards sit idle or
                  get spent on purchases, Robinhood rewards can grow through the
                  power of compound returns. You can also redeem points for
                  travel bookings, gift cards, statement credits, or special
                  items like metal card upgrades and airport lounge passes.

                  upgrade to stainless steel for an additional fee if they want

                  The Robinhood Gold Card requires an active Robinhood Gold
                  subscription ($5/month or $50/year) to apply for the card and
                  maintain it. If you cancel your Gold membership, you may lose
                  access to your card. The Gold subscription includes other
                  benefits like 3% APY on uninvested cash, professional research
                  from Morningstar, and Level II market data.

                  Cash back is calculated in points (1 point = 1 cent when
                  redeemed for cash in Robinhood brokerage). Some redemption
                  options may offer less than 1 cent per point value. You must
                  have a Robinhood Financial brokerage account to redeem points
                  for cash. Points may be rescinded if you fail to pay at least
                  the minimum payment due. Certain transactions don't earn
                  points, including balance transfers, cash advances, and
                  business-type purchases.
