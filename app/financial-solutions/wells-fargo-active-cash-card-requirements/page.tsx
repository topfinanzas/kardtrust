                The Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card represents one of the most
                accessible premium cash back credit cards in the United States,
                combining unlimited 2% cash back on all purchases with no annual
                fee and comprehensive Visa Signature benefits. While Wells Fargo
                maintains reasonable eligibility criteria to ensure responsible
                credit usage, the Active Cash® Card is generally more accessible
                than many premium rewards cards and serves as an excellent
                option for consumers with good to excellent credit. Here's
                everything you need to know about qualifying, applying, and
                understanding the costs associated with the Wells Fargo Active
                Cash® Card.

                      The Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card typically requires a
                      credit score of 670 or higher (good credit range), though
                      many approved applicants have scores of 700+. Wells Fargo
                      evaluates your FICO® Score from major credit bureaus
                      (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion) along with your overall
                      credit profile to determine creditworthiness. A strong
                      credit history includes consistent on-time payment history
                      (no recent late payments or collections), credit
                      utilization below 30% of available limits, at least 2-3
                      years of credit history (though longer is better), and a
                      diverse mix of credit accounts including revolving credit
                      (credit cards) and installment loans (auto loans,
                      mortgages, personal loans). Before applying, check your
                      credit reports for accuracy at AnnualCreditReport.com and
                      dispute any errors that could negatively impact your
                      application.

                      Wells Fargo applies specific restrictions on consumer
                      credit card applications. You may not qualify for an
                      additional Wells Fargo-branded consumer credit card if you
                      have opened a Wells Fargo-branded consumer credit card
                      within the last 6 months—this is Wells Fargo's "6-month
                      rule" that limits how frequently you can open new Wells
                      Fargo cards. Additionally, you may not be eligible for
                      introductory annual percentage rates, fees, and/or rewards
                      bonus offers if you currently have the Active Cash® Card
                      or opened one within the last 48 months from the date of
                      application—even if that previous account is now closed
                      and has a $0 balance. This 48-month restriction
                      specifically applies to bonus eligibility, not card
                      approval itself, so existing cardholders who want to
                      switch products should be aware they won't receive the
                      $200 welcome bonus or 0% intro APR offers.

                      You must be at least 18 years old (19 in Alabama and
                      Nebraska, 21 in Mississippi and Puerto Rico) and either a
                      US citizen, permanent resident with a valid Social
                      Security Number, or resident alien with an Individual
                      Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). Wells Fargo
                      requires a permanent US residential address—P.O. boxes are
                      not accepted as primary addresses, though they can be
                      listed as separate mailing addresses. Military personnel
                      stationed overseas can apply using their APO/FPO address.
                      You must have verifiable income or access to income
                      sufficient to demonstrate ability to repay credit
                      obligations in accordance with federal regulations and

                      Wells Fargo requires applicants to provide their annual
                      gross income, which includes salary, wages, bonuses,
                      commissions, self-employment income, rental property
                      income, investment income, retirement distributions
                      (Social Security, pensions, 401(k) withdrawals), alimony,
                      child support, and other regular income sources that can
                      be verified. If you're 21 or older, you can include
                      household income you have reasonable access to and
                      expectation to use for credit card payments (such as a
                      spouse's or partner's income, even if you're not
                      employed). If you're under 21, federal regulations
                      restrict you to reporting only personal income or income
                      for which you're a co-signer or guarantor. While Wells
                      Fargo doesn't publish minimum income requirements for the
                      Active Cash® Card, having stable, verifiable income
                      significantly improves approval chances and typically
                      results in higher initial credit limits.

                      While not required, having an existing relationship with
                      Wells Fargo (checking account, savings account, mortgage,
                      or other Wells Fargo credit card) may positively influence
                      your application, especially if you maintain positive
                      account history with no overdrafts, returned payments, or
                      delinquencies. Existing Wells Fargo customers often report
                      smoother application experiences and may receive targeted
                      offers with enhanced terms. However, if you have negative
                      history with Wells Fargo (closed accounts due to
                      delinquency, chargeoffs, or collections), this will
                      negatively impact your application and likely result in
                      automatic denial even if your credit scores are

                      income verification documents if Wells Fargo requests them
                      during application review or within 30 days of account
                      opening. Acceptable documentation includes recent pay
                      stubs (last 2-3 months showing year-to-date earnings), W-2
                      forms or tax returns for the most recent year, bank

                      and provide your monthly housing payment amount (mortgage
                      or rent). If you own your home, Wells Fargo may ask about
                      your estimated home value and remaining mortgage balance
                      as part of their financial assessment and debt-to-income
                      ratio calculation. This information helps Wells Fargo
                      evaluate your overall financial stability, debt
                      obligations, and ability to manage additional credit
                      responsibly. If you live rent-free with family, indicate
                      this accurately on the application—do not inflate housing
                      costs as this constitutes fraud and can result in

                  Understanding the Costs: APR, Fees & Charges
                </h2>
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-5 mb-4 text-left">
                  <strong>Annual Fee:</strong> $0 - The Wells Fargo Active Cash®
                  Card charges no annual fee, making it one of the most valuable
                  premium rewards cards available without ongoing yearly costs.
                  You'll never pay a fee simply to keep this card active,
                  regardless of how much or how little you use it.

                <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-5 mb-4 text-left">
                  <strong>Purchase APR:</strong> 0% intro APR for 12 months from
                  account opening on purchases. After the intro period, a
                  variable APR of 18.99%, 24.99%, or 28.99% applies based on
                  your creditworthiness. Your specific APR will be disclosed in
                  your approval notice and depends on factors including your
                  credit score, credit history, income, and debt-to-income
                  ratio. For example, if you have a $4,000 balance at 24.99% APR
                  (midpoint) after the intro period and make only minimum
                  payments, you'd pay approximately $1,000 in interest over one
                  year, assuming no additional purchases. To avoid interest
                  charges entirely, pay your full statement balance by the due
                  date each month during and after the intro period.

                <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-5 mb-4 text-left">
                  <strong>Balance Transfer APR:</strong> 0% intro APR for 12
                  months from account opening on qualifying balance transfers
                  made within 120 days of account opening. After the intro
                  period, the same variable APR of 18.99%, 24.99%, or 28.99%
                  applies to any remaining balance. Balance transfer fee: Either
                  $5 or 5% of the amount of each transfer, whichever is greater.
                  For example, transferring $6,000 would incur a $300 fee (5% of
                  $6,000), but you'd save approximately $768 in interest charges
                  over 12 months compared to leaving that balance on a card
                  charging 24% APR, resulting in a net savings of $468 even
                  after the transfer fee.

                  <strong>Cash Advance APR:</strong> Variable APR applies to
                  cash advances (typically 28.99% or higher based on your
                  creditworthiness). Cash advance fee: Either $10 or 5% of the
                  amount of each cash advance, whichever is greater. Cash
                  advances begin accruing interest immediately with no grace
                  period and are generally not recommended due to high costs.
                  Wells Fargo also considers ATM withdrawals, cash equivalents
                  (money orders, traveler's checks, prepaid gift cards), casino
                  gaming chips, wire transfers, and peer-to-peer payments as
                  cash advances or cash equivalents that don't earn rewards and
                  incur fees.

                  <strong>Foreign Transaction Fee:</strong> $0 - The Wells Fargo
                  Active Cash® Card charges no foreign transaction fees, making
                  it an excellent choice for international travel. You can use
                  your card abroad and earn unlimited 2% cash back on all
                  foreign purchases without incurring the typical 3% foreign
                  transaction fees charged by many other cards. This saves $30
                  on every $1,000 spent internationally compared to cards with
                  foreign transaction fees.

                  <strong>Late Payment Fee:</strong> Up to $41 if you fail to
                  make at least the minimum payment by the due date. The first
                  late payment fee is up to $30; subsequent late payments within
                  the next six billing cycles result in fees up to $41.
                  Additionally, late payments can trigger penalty APRs, damage
                  your credit score, and result in loss of promotional APR
                  offers. Set up automatic payments through Wells Fargo Online®
                  or the Wells Fargo mobile app to avoid late fees and protect
                  your credit score.

                  <strong>Returned Payment Fee:</strong> Up to $41 if your
                  payment is returned unpaid due to insufficient funds or closed
                  account. Ensure sufficient funds are available in your payment
                  account before the due date to avoid this fee. Returned
                  payments can also result in late fees, penalty APRs, and
                  negative credit reporting if the minimum payment is not made
                  by the due date.

                  <strong>Step 1: Review Your Credit Profile</strong> - Before
                  applying, check your credit score and credit reports at
                  AnnualCreditReport.com to ensure accuracy. Verify your credit
                  score is at least 670 (preferably 700+) and review your credit
                  reports for errors, incorrect information, or negative items
                  that could impact your application. Dispute any errors with
                  the credit bureaus at least 30-60 days before applying. If
                  your credit needs improvement, consider waiting several months
                  while building positive payment history, reducing credit
                  utilization below 30%, and addressing any collections or
                  delinquencies before applying for premium rewards cards like
                  the Active Cash®.

                <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-5 mb-4 text-left">
                  <strong>Step 2: Gather Required Information</strong> - Collect
                  all necessary information and documents including your Social
                  Security Number, current and previous addresses (2 years
                  history), annual gross income documentation, employer
                  information and contact details, monthly housing payment
                  amount, and identification documents. If you have an existing
                  Wells Fargo account, have your Wells Fargo username and
                  password ready to sign in during the application, which may
                  pre-fill some fields with information from your profile and
                  potentially improve approval chances if you have a positive
                  relationship with Wells Fargo.

                  fields accurately, including personal information, income
                  details, housing information, and employment data.
                  Double-check all entries for accuracy before submitting, as
                  errors or inconsistencies can delay processing, trigger
                  requests for additional documentation, or result in denial.
                  The application typically takes 5-10 minutes to complete.
                  Wells Fargo uses secure encryption to protect your personal
                  and financial information throughout the application process.

                  approval or denial decisions within 30-60 seconds of
                  submitting their application. If your application requires
                  further review, Wells Fargo will notify you that a decision
                  will be provided within 7-10 business days. You can check your

                  your Wells Fargo account online. If approved, you'll receive
                  notification of your credit limit, APR, and account terms. If
                  additional verification is needed, Wells Fargo will contact
                  you by phone, email, or mail with specific document
                  requests—respond promptly to avoid application expiration
                  (typically 30 days).

                    <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-5 text-left">
                      A: While Wells Fargo doesn't publish official credit score
                      requirements, the Active Cash® Card typically requires a
                      credit score of 670 or higher (good credit range). Most
                      approved applicants report credit scores of 700+. Wells
                      Fargo considers your entire credit profile, including
                      payment history (especially recent payment behavior),
                      credit utilization ratios, length of credit history,
                      recent credit inquiries, and types of credit accounts.
                      Having a strong credit profile beyond just the score—such
                      as no recent late payments, utilization below 30%, and
                      several years of credit history—significantly improves
                      your approval chances and may result in a higher credit
                      limit and better APR terms.

                      A: It depends on which Wells Fargo card you currently have
                      and when you opened it. If you currently have the Wells
                      Fargo Active Cash® Card or opened one within the past 48
                      months, you will not be eligible for the $200 welcome
                      bonus or 0% intro APR offers, even if you apply for a new
                      account. If you have a different Wells Fargo credit card
                      (such as the Wells Fargo Autograph℠ Card, Reflect® Card,
                      or Platinum Card), you may still be eligible for the
                      Active Cash® bonus and intro APR, but you cannot have
                      opened any Wells Fargo-branded consumer credit card within
                      the last 6 months. Current Wells Fargo cardholders who
                      want to switch products can request a product change
                      (which will not include bonus or intro APR offers) rather

                      solid value for international travelers despite not being
                      a dedicated travel rewards card.

                      A: Balance transfers to your Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card
                      typically take 7-21 days to complete from the date Wells
                      Fargo receives and processes your balance transfer
                      request. During this time, you must continue making at
                      least minimum payments on your other credit cards to avoid
                      late fees and credit damage—do not assume the transfer is
                      complete until you receive confirmation from Wells Fargo
                      and verification that the balances no longer appear on
                      your other cards. To qualify for the 0% intro APR on
                      balance transfers, they must be made within 120 days of
                      account opening. Balance transfer requests can be
                      submitted online through Wells Fargo Online®, via the
                      Wells Fargo mobile app, by phone at 1-800-967-9521, or by
                      using balance transfer checks if Wells Fargo provides them
                      with your account.

                      A: Wells Fargo Rewards earned on the Active Cash® Card are
                      cash back rewards, not transferable travel points like
                      Chase Ultimate Rewards or American Express Membership
                      Rewards. However, you have flexible redemption options
                      including: cash back as statement credits applied to your
                      account balance; direct deposits to your Wells Fargo
                      checking or savings account; redemption toward eligible
                      purchases you've already made ("Redeem for Purchases");
                      gift cards and eGift cards from popular brands starting at
                      $10; and Pay with Rewards to shop at millions of online
                      retailers through PayPal. Rewards redeem at a fixed value
                      of 1 cent per reward point, so your 2% earnings are always
                      worth 2 cents per dollar spent. Unlike travel rewards
                      programs, you won't get enhanced redemption values by
                      booking through a travel portal or transferring to airline
                      partners, but you gain simplicity and predictability in
                      your rewards value.

                      Q: What happens if I don't pay off my balance before the
                      0% intro APR period ends?

                      A: If you carry a balance after the 12-month 0% intro APR
                      period ends, the remaining balance will be subject to the
                      card's variable APR of 18.99%, 24.99%, or 28.99% starting
                      with the 13th billing cycle. Interest will accrue on any
                      remaining balance from that point forward at your assigned
                      APR rate. For example, if you transfer $8,000 and pay off
                      $6,000 during the intro period, the remaining $2,000
                      balance will accrue interest at your variable
                      APR—potentially $40-$48 per month in interest charges at
                      24.99% APR. To avoid interest charges entirely, create a
                      structured payment plan to eliminate the full balance
                      before the intro period expires. Divide your total balance
                      by 12 months to determine the monthly payment needed to
                      become debt-free without paying interest. Set up automatic
                      payments for this amount to ensure consistent progress
                      toward your payoff goal.

                  ⚠️ Important Disclosure

                <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-5 mb-3 text-left">
                  <strong>Representative APR Example:</strong> When you carry a
                  balance after the 12-month intro period, you will be charged
                  interest. For example, if you have a balance of $4,000 at a
                  variable APR of 24.99% (midpoint of the 18.99% - 28.99% range)
                  and make only minimum payments, you would pay approximately
                  $1,000 in interest over one year, assuming no additional
                  purchases. Your actual APR depends on your creditworthiness
                  and will be disclosed during the application process.

                <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-5 mb-3 text-left">
                  <strong>Credit Impact:</strong> Applying for a credit card
                  results in a hard inquiry on your credit report, which may
                  temporarily lower your credit score by 2-5 points. Opening a
                  new credit account affects your average age of accounts and
                  can impact your score in the short term. However, responsible
                  use (on-time payments, low utilization below 30%) typically
                  improves your credit score over 6-12 months through positive
                  payment history and increased available credit.
                </p>
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-5 mb-3 text-left">
                  <strong>Risk Warning:</strong> Credit cards are a form of
                  borrowing. Missing payments can damage your credit score
                  (drops of 60-110 points for a single 30-day late payment),
                  result in late fees up to $41, trigger penalty APRs, and lead
                  to collection actions if delinquency continues. High credit
                  utilization (using more than 30% of your available credit) can
                  negatively impact your credit score. Only apply for credit if
                  you can manage repayment responsibly. The 0% intro APR is
                  temporary—plan to pay off balances before the 12-month
                  promotional period ends to avoid interest charges at the
                  standard variable APR.
