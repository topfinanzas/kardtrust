                The Citi Custom Cash® Card represents one of the most innovative
                cash back credit cards available in the United States, offering
                automatic 5% cash back on your top spending category without
                requiring activation or enrollment. While Citi maintains
                reasonable eligibility criteria to ensure responsible credit
                usage, the card is generally accessible to applicants with good
                to excellent credit who demonstrate financial stability.
                Importantly, Citi enforces a strict one-card-per-person policy
                for the Custom Cash® Card and imposes a 48-month restriction on
                welcome bonus eligibility for those who have previously held the
                card or converted from another Citi product. Here's everything
                you need to know about qualifying, applying, and understanding
                the costs associated with this intelligent rewards card.

                      The Citi Custom Cash® Card typically requires a credit
                      score of 670 or higher (good credit range), though many
                      approved applicants report credit scores of 700+. Citi
                      evaluates your FICO® Score from major credit bureaus
                      (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion) along with your overall
                      credit profile including payment history, credit
                      utilization, length of credit history, recent credit
                      inquiries, and mix of credit accounts. A strong credit
                      history includes consistent on-time payment history with
                      no recent late payments or collections, credit utilization
                      below 30% of available limits (preferably below 10% for
                      optimal approval chances), at least 2-3 years of credit
                      history though longer is better, and a diverse mix of
                      credit accounts including revolving credit (credit cards)
                      and installment loans. Before applying, check your credit
                      reports for accuracy at AnnualCreditReport.com and dispute
                      any errors that could negatively impact your application.

                      Citi will only issue one Citi Custom Cash® Card account
                      per person—this is a strict, non-negotiable policy
                      enforced by Citi's systems. If you currently have a Custom
                      Cash® Card, you cannot apply for an additional one, even
                      if your first account is closed. If you've had a Custom
                      Cash® Card in the past (whether currently open or
                      previously closed), you cannot open a new Custom Cash®
                      Card account. This differs from many other credit cards
                      where you can apply for multiple accounts over time.
                      Additionally, you are not eligible for the $200 welcome
                      bonus if you received a new account bonus for a Citi
                      Custom Cash® Card in the past 48 months (4 years), or if
                      you converted another Citi credit card on which you earned
                      a new account bonus in the last 48 months into a Citi
                      Custom Cash® Card. This means even if you product-changed
                      from a different Citi card that had a bonus to the Custom
                      Cash, you're ineligible for the Custom Cash welcome offer
                      for 48 months from when you earned the original bonus.

                      US citizen, permanent resident with a valid Social
                      Security Number, or resident alien with an Individual
                      Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). Citi requires a
                      permanent US residential address—P.O. boxes are not
                      accepted as primary addresses, though they can be listed

                      Citi requires applicants to provide their annual gross
                      income, which includes salary, wages, bonuses,
                      commissions, self-employment income, rental property
                      income, investment income, retirement distributions

                      child support, and other regular income sources that can
                      be verified. If you're 21 or older, you can include
                      household income you have reasonable access to and
                      expectation to use for credit card payments (such as a
                      spouse's or partner's income, even if you're not
                      employed). If you're under 21, federal regulations
                      restrict you to reporting only personal income or income
                      for which you're a co-signer or guarantor. While Citi
                      doesn't publish minimum income requirements for the Custom
                      Cash® Card, having stable, verifiable income significantly
                      improves approval chances and typically results in higher

                      Citi (checking account, savings account, investment
                      account, mortgage, or other Citi credit card) may
                      positively influence your application, especially if you
                      maintain positive account history with no overdrafts,
                      returned payments, or delinquencies. Existing Citi
                      customers often report smoother application experiences
                      and may receive targeted offers with enhanced terms.
                      However, if you have negative history with Citi (closed
                      accounts due to delinquency, chargeoffs, or collections),
                      this will negatively impact your application and likely
                      result in automatic denial even if your credit scores are
                      sufficient. Citi also considers your existing Citi credit
                      card portfolio—holding multiple Citi cards with high
                      balances or utilization may reduce approval chances or
                      result in lower credit limits on new applications.

                      part of their financial assessment and debt-to-income
                      ratio calculation. This information helps Citi evaluate
                      your overall financial stability, debt obligations, and
                      ability to manage additional credit responsibly. If you
                      live rent-free with family, indicate this accurately on
                      the application—do not inflate housing costs as this
                      constitutes fraud and can result in application denial or
                      account closure if discovered.

                  <strong>Annual Fee:</strong> $0 - The Citi Custom Cash® Card
                  charges no annual fee, making premium automatic 5% cash back
                  rewards accessible without ongoing yearly costs. You'll never
                  pay a fee simply to keep this card active, regardless of how

                  <strong>Purchase APR:</strong> Variable APR of 17.99% - 27.99%
                  based on your creditworthiness. Your specific APR will be
                  disclosed in your approval notice and depends on factors
                  including your credit score, credit history, income, and
                  debt-to-income ratio. For example, if you have a $3,000
                  balance at 22.99% APR (midpoint) and make only minimum
                  payments, you'd pay approximately $689 in interest over one
                  year. To avoid interest charges entirely, pay your full
                  statement balance by the due date each month.

                  <strong>Balance Transfer APR:</strong> 0% intro APR for 18
                  months from account opening on balance transfers completed
                  within 4 months of account opening. After the intro period,
                  the variable APR of 17.99% - 27.99% applies to any remaining
                  balance. Balance transfer fee: Either $5 or 5% of the amount
                  of each transfer, whichever is greater. For example,
                  transferring $6,000 would incur a $300 fee (5% of $6,000), but
                  you'd save approximately $1,320 in interest charges over 18
                  months compared to leaving that balance on a card charging 22%
                  APR, resulting in a net savings of $1,020 even after the
                  transfer fee. Note: The intro APR applies only to balance
                  transfers, not purchases.

                  <strong>Cash Advance APR:</strong> Variable APR applies to
                  cash advances (typically 27.99% or higher based on your
                  creditworthiness). Cash advance fee: Either $10 or 5% of the
                  amount of each cash advance, whichever is greater. Cash
                  advances begin accruing interest immediately with no grace
                  period and are generally not recommended due to high costs.
                  Citi also considers ATM withdrawals, cash equivalents (money
                  orders, traveler's checks, prepaid gift cards), casino gaming
                  chips, wire transfers, and peer-to-peer payments as cash
                  advances or cash equivalents that don't earn rewards and incur

                  a foreign transaction fee of 3% on purchases made outside the
                  United States or with foreign merchants. If you travel
                  internationally frequently or make regular foreign purchases,

                  <strong>Late Payment Fee:</strong> Up to $40 if you fail to
                  make at least the minimum payment by the due date. The first
                  late payment fee is up to $30; subsequent late payments within
                  the next six billing cycles result in fees up to $40.
                  Additionally, late payments can trigger penalty APRs up to
                  29.99%, damage your credit score significantly (drops of
                  60-110 points for a single 30-day late payment), and result in
                  loss of promotional APR offers. Set up automatic payments
                  through Citi Online or the Citi Mobile® App to avoid late fees
                  and protect your credit score.

                  account. Ensure sufficient funds are available in your payment
                  account before the due date to avoid this fee. Returned
                  payments can also result in late fees, penalty APRs, and
                  negative credit reporting if the minimum payment is not made
                  by the due date.

                  your calculated interest would be less than $0.50, you'll be
                  charged the minimum $0.50 fee. This applies when you carry any

                  <strong>Step 1: Review Your Credit Profile</strong> - Before
                  applying, check your credit score and credit reports at
                  AnnualCreditReport.com to ensure accuracy. Verify your credit
                  score is at least 670 (preferably 700+) and review your credit
                  reports for errors, incorrect information, or negative items
                  that could impact your application. Dispute any errors with
                  the credit bureaus at least 30-60 days before applying. If
                  your credit needs improvement, consider waiting several months
                  while building positive payment history, reducing credit
                  utilization below 30%, and addressing any collections or
                  delinquencies before applying for premium rewards cards like
                  the Custom Cash.

                <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-5 mb-4 text-left">
                  <strong>Step 2: Verify Eligibility for Welcome Bonus</strong>{" "}
                  - Confirm you haven't received a new account bonus for a Citi
                  Custom Cash® Card in the past 48 months. Check if you've
                  converted another Citi credit card (on which you earned a new
                  account bonus in the last 48 months) into a Citi Custom Cash®
                  Card, as this also disqualifies you from the welcome offer.
                  Remember that Citi will only issue one Citi Custom Cash® Card
                  per person—if you currently have or previously had a Custom
                  Cash account (even if closed), you cannot apply for a new one.
                  If you're unsure about your Citi credit card history, review
                  your credit reports or contact Citi customer service before
                  applying.

                  all necessary information and documents including your Social
                  Security Number or ITIN, current and previous addresses (2
                  years history), annual gross income documentation, employer
                  information and contact details, monthly housing payment
                  amount, and identification documents. If you have an existing
                  Citi account, have your Citi username and password ready to
                  sign in during the application, which may pre-fill some fields
                  with information from your profile and potentially improve
                  approval chances if you have a positive relationship with
                  Citi.

                  information, and employment data. Double-check all entries for
                  accuracy before submitting, as errors or inconsistencies can
                  delay processing, trigger requests for additional
                  documentation, or result in denial. The application typically
                  takes 5-10 minutes to complete. Citi uses secure encryption to
                  protect your personal and financial information throughout the
                  application process.

                  approval or denial decisions within 30-60 seconds of
                  submitting their application. If your application requires
                  further review, Citi will notify you that a decision will be
                  provided within 7-10 business days. You can check your
                  application status by calling Citi's automated application
                  status line at 1-800-362-0526 or by signing into your Citi
                  account online. If approved, you'll receive notification of
                  your credit limit, APR, and account terms. If additional
                  verification is needed, Citi will contact you by phone, email,
                  or mail with specific document requests—respond promptly to
                  avoid application expiration (typically 30 days).

                      A: While Citi doesn't publish official credit score
                      requirements, the Custom Cash® Card typically requires a
                      credit score of 670 or higher (good credit range). Most
                      approved applicants report credit scores of 700+. Citi
                      considers your entire credit profile, including payment
                      history (especially recent payment behavior), credit
                      utilization ratios, length of credit history, recent
                      credit inquiries, and types of credit accounts. Having a
                      strong credit profile beyond just the score—such as no
                      recent late payments, utilization below 30%, and several
                      years of credit history—significantly improves your
                      approval chances and may result in a higher credit limit

                      for the $200 welcome bonus if you received a new account
                      bonus for a Citi Custom Cash® Card in the past 48 months,
                      or if you converted another Citi credit card (on which you
                      earned a new account bonus in the last 48 months) into a
                      Citi Custom Cash® Card. This 48-month restriction is
                      specific to the Custom Cash product and its bonus—bonuses
                      earned on other Citi cards don't affect your eligibility
                      for the Custom Cash bonus unless you product-changed that
                      card to the Custom Cash.

                      Q: How does the automatic 5% category selection work? Do I
                      need to activate anything?
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-5 text-left">
                      A: The automatic category selection is completely
                      hands-off and requires no activation, enrollment, or
                      manual intervention. Each billing cycle, Citi's systems
                      automatically analyze your spending across the 10 eligible
                      categories (restaurants, gas stations, grocery stores,
                      select travel, select transit, select streaming services,
                      drugstores, home improvement stores, fitness clubs, live
                      entertainment) and identify which category had your
                      highest spending. You automatically earn 5% cash back (5
                      ThankYou® Points per $1) on up to $500 spent in that top
                      category, and 1% cash back on all other purchases. You can
                      view which category is currently earning 5% in the Citi
                      Mobile® App or online account, but you don't need to
                      select or activate anything—it happens automatically in
                      the background based on your actual spending behavior.

                      A: No, ThankYou® Points earned on the Citi Custom Cash®
                      Card cannot be transferred to airline or hotel loyalty
                      programs. Point transfers to partners like Emirates,
                      Singapore Airlines, JetBlue, and Wyndham Hotels are
                      exclusive to Citi's premium ThankYou® Points-earning cards
                      such as the Citi Premier® Card and Citi Prestige® Card.
                      However, you can redeem Custom Cash points for cash back
                      (statement credit, direct deposit, or check), gift cards,
                      travel bookings through Citi Travel, merchandise, Shop
                      with Points at Amazon.com, student loan payments, mortgage
                      payments, and charitable donations. If you want transfer
                      capabilities, consider pairing the Custom Cash with the
                      Citi Premier® Card—points from both cards pool into your
                      ThankYou® account, and once pooled, you can transfer the
                      combined balance to airline/hotel partners using the
                      Premier's transfer capabilities.

                      A: Due to Citi's strict one-card-per-person policy for the
                      Custom Cash® Card, once you close your Citi Custom Cash®
                      Card account, you cannot reopen it or apply for a new Citi
                      Custom Cash® Card in the future. This restriction is
                      permanent and applies even years after closing your
                      original account. Before closing your Custom Cash account,
                      consider whether you might want the card in the future, as
                      you'll lose the ability to have this product forever. If
                      you're considering closing the card due to wanting
                      different benefits, explore product change options with
                      Citi—you might be able to convert your Custom Cash to a
                      different Citi card (like the Double Cash® or Simplicity®)
                      while preserving your credit history and keeping the
                      account open, though you'd lose the Custom Cash benefits.
                      Contact Citi customer service to discuss product change
                      alternatives before closing the account permanently.

                      Q: Does the 0% intro APR apply to purchases or only
                      balance transfers?
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-5 text-left">
                      A: The 0% intro APR applies only to balance transfers
                      completed within 4 months of account opening for 18
                      months. The intro rate does not apply to purchases—new
                      purchases are subject to the standard variable APR of
                      17.99% - 27.99% from day one. However, you can avoid
                      interest on purchases entirely by paying your full
                      statement balance by the due date each month, which
                      provides an interest-free grace period on new purchases.
                      If you carry a balance after making a balance transfer,
                      interest will be charged on your purchases unless you pay
                      your entire balance (including balance transfers and new
                      purchases) by the due date each month. For optimal
                      results, focus on paying down your transferred balance
                      during the 18-month intro period while paying new
                      purchases in full monthly to avoid interest charges
                      altogether.

                  ⚠️ Important Disclosure

                <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-5 mb-3 text-left">
                  <strong>Representative APR Example:</strong> The Citi Custom
                  Cash® Card has a variable APR of 17.99% - 27.99% for purchases
                  based on your creditworthiness. If you carry a balance of
                  $3,000 at the midpoint APR of 22.99% and make only minimum
                  payments, you would pay approximately $689 in interest charges
                  over one year. To avoid interest charges entirely, pay your
                  full statement balance by the due date each month. Balance
                  transfer intro APR: 0% for 18 months on transfers completed
                  within 4 months of account opening; thereafter 17.99% - 27.99%
                  variable APR. Balance transfer fee: $5 or 5% of each transfer,
                  whichever is greater.

                <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-5 mb-3 text-left">
                  <strong>Credit Impact:</strong> Applying for a credit card
                  results in a hard inquiry on your credit report, which may
                  temporarily lower your credit score by 2-5 points. Opening a
                  new credit account affects your average age of accounts and
                  can impact your score in the short term. However, responsible
                  use (on-time payments, low utilization below 30%) typically
                  improves your credit score over 6-12 months through positive
                  payment history and increased available credit.
                </p>
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-5 mb-3 text-left">
                  <strong>Risk Warning:</strong> Credit cards are a form of
                  borrowing. Missing payments can damage your credit score
                  significantly (drops of 60-110 points for a single 30-day late
                  payment), result in late fees up to $40, and trigger penalty
                  APRs up to 29.99%. High credit utilization (using more than
                  30% of your available credit) can negatively impact your
                  credit score. Only apply for credit if you can manage
                  repayment responsibly. The 0% intro APR is temporary and
                  applies only to balance transfers—plan to pay off balances
                  before the 18-month promotional period ends to avoid interest
                  charges at the standard variable APR.
